  - [ ] Create/edit documents with Article → Section → Subsection structure
  - [ ] Manage sections and subsections
  - [ ] Add/edit cross-references between sections
  - [ ] Manage document type references (General mentions, Magazines, Doctrine, etc.)
- [ ] Implement blog article management (create, edit, delete)
- [ ] Add edit modals and inline editing
- [ ] Implement delete confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Make admin UI visually distinct from user interface
- [ ] Reference management tools for creating cross-references

## **User Management & Authentication**
- [ ] Implement user registration and login
- [ ] Create user profile management
- [ ] Set up authentication-based conditional rendering
- [ ] Implement public vs. premium content gating
- [ ] Add route guarding for protected content

## **Navigation & UX**
- [ ] Design main navigation structure
- [ ] Implement seamless navigation between sections
- [ ] Create breadcrumbs and navigation shortcuts
- [ ] Ensure responsive navigation across devices
- [ ] Add loading states and user feedback
- [ ] Implement hierarchical navigation (Document → Article → Section → Subsection)
- [ ] Add quick navigation between sections

## **Server-side vs Client-side Decisions**
- [ ] Define which parts run on server vs client
- [ ] Implement SSR for SEO-critical pages
- [ ] Set up API routes for dynamic content
- [ ] Document reasoning for architectural choices
- [ ] Consider security implications of data exposure

## **Content & Mock Data**
- [ ] Generate contextually appropriate legal content with hierarchical structure
- [ ] Create mock legal documents following the pattern:
  ```
  Document: "Civil Code 2024"
  ├── Article 43: "Lack of exercise capacity"
  │   ├── Section 43.1: "General provisions"
  │   │   ├── Subsection 43.1.1: "Minor definitions"
  │   │   └── Subsection 43.1.2: "Guardianship measures"
  │   └── Section 43.2: "Legal representation"
  ```
- [ ] Generate blog articles about legal topics with section references
- [ ] Ensure content is in plain English and legally themed
- [ ] Add appropriate tags and categories
- [ ] Include document type reference counts and amendment notes in mock data
- [ ] Create realistic cross-references between sections

## **Bonus Features (Optional)**
- [ ] Integrate Ollama or similar LLM
- [ ] Implement document summarization
- [ ] Add related content suggestions
- [ ] Create question-answering on documents
- [ ] Generate automatic tags/categories

## **Testing & Quality**
- [ ] Set up unit testing with Vitest/Jest
- [ ] Implement E2E testing with Playwright/Cypress

## **Documentation**
- [ ] Write comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Document installation and setup instructions
- [ ] Explain key architectural decisions
- [ ] Document authentication and security approach
- [ ] Add code comments explaining "why" not just "how"
- [ ] Document hierarchical data model and reference system design

## **Deployment & DevOps**
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (optional but encouraged)
- [ ] Configure production environment
- [ ] Test Docker deployment
- [ ] Document deployment process



## **Key Implementation Focus Areas:**
1. **Hierarchical Structure:** Implement Document → Article → Section → Subsection with consistent naming
2. **Granular References:** Focus on section-to-section and blog-to-section references
3. **Legal Conventions:** Follow real-world legal document patterns (Section 1.2 references Section 1.1)
4. **Document Type References:** Include reference counts to other document types (General mentions, Magazines, Doctrine, etc.)
5. **Scalable Foundation:** Design for future extensibility without over-engineering

## **Client Clarifications Summary:**
- Nesting down to Subsection 1.1.1 is sufficient
- Use Article → Section → Subsection naming convention for consistency
- Focus on section-to-section references (Section 1.2 references Section 1.1)
- Blog posts can reference specific sections
- Cross-document article-to-article references are sufficient
- **FOCUS ON LAW DOCUMENTS ONLY:** General mentions, Magazines, Doctrine, etc. are different document types (not metadata)
- Show amendment notes with dates and law references
- Design for scalability and future extensibility
